# Stickman

A side-scrolling base defense strategy game built with Phaser 3 and Vite.

## Inspiration

This game is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi3Txc0_2eQ) and the classic "Age of War" genre of games — where two bases sit on opposite ends of an arena and each side spawns units that march toward the enemy, fighting anything in their path. The goal is to destroy the enemy base before they destroy yours.

We're not trying to make an exact copy of any existing game. Instead, we're building something that captures the same fun — the tug-of-war tension of spawning the right units at the right time — while putting our own spin on it.

## How to play

- You have a base on the left. The enemy has a base on the right.
- Spend gold to spawn warriors that march toward the enemy base.
- Enemy units spawn automatically and march toward your base.
- When opposing units meet, they fight.
- Destroy the enemy base to win. If your base falls, you lose.
- Gold is earned passively over time and by killing enemy units.

## Getting started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Future home

The goal is to eventually host this game on [www.luppes.com](http://www.luppes.com), a website maintained by Teddy's grandpa. It's already home to all kinds of cool stuff — including how to do corn — and this game will fit right in.
